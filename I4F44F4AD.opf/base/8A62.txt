Bodhisattvacaryānirdeśa
----------
(The Lord stays in Vaiśālī in the Kūṭāgāraśālā with a thousand monks described with items from the catalogue generally used to describe them, evaṃ mayā śrutam ekasmin samaye bhagavān vaiśālyāṃ viharati sma mahāvane kūṭāgāraśālāyāṃ mahatā bhikṣusaṃghena sārdhaṃ bhikṣusahasraiḥ sarvaiḥ kṣīnāsravair niṣkleśair vaśībhūtaiḥ etc. Only Ānanda is not an arhat, ekapudgalaṃ sthāpayitvā yad utāyuṣmantam ānandam).

(The arrival of the Lord to Vaiśālī is accompanied by miracles.)
(The main character, the three years old boy (dāraka) Ratnadatta, is introduced. Sitting on the lap of his nurse he sees the miracles)
(and he wonders, in seven verses, from where they arise.)
(The nurse then praises the Lord in thirty-three verses based on tathāgatasya paryāyanāmāni, the dvātriṃśanmahāpuruṣalakṣaṇāni, the aśītyanuvyañjanāni, and the ṣaṣṭyaṅgasvaranāmāni.)
(Ratnadatta sees the Lord and offers Him a lotus of gold:) Then the boy Ratnadatta told his nurse: “Put me in the window so that I can see the Tathāgata!” The nurse then put him in the window.The Lord read the thoughts of Ratnadatta (ratnadattasya dārakasya cetasaiva cetaḥparivitarkam ājñāya), and went to that lane.The boy Ratnadatta saw the Lord approaching, and he thought: “Those who do not produce the thought of awakening (bodhicitta) having seen the Tathāgata with all his qualities (guṇa), are indeed unlucky!”Then the Lord went to the gate of Ratnadatta. Ratnadatta thought: “Such a remarkable being is difficult to find even in hundred thousand times ten millons of world aeons (śatasahasrakoṭikalpa).I have to give an offering from this pavillion”, and he carried on the palm of his hand a lotus with a hundred thousand petals made of pure gold.Then he jumped down from the pavillion, and by the power of the Buddha (buddhānubhāva) he sat down in the air.Then the boy Ratnadatta offered the lotus, made of pure gold and with a hundred thousand petals, to the Lord; and as soon as it was out of the hands of the boy, the Lord made it into a lotus parasol in the space over his head and spread out a net of jewels.
(Verses on the meaning (artha) of making an offering:) Then the boy Ratnadatta spoke the following verses:
When I offer this lotus to the Lord I do not wish anything in particular. Rather, in taking away all meaning (sarvārthopacchedanāya), I seek the ultimate awakening (varabodhi) (1).In accordance with the fact that in the unborn (anutpanna) awakening there is no attainment or loss, no accepting or giving away, I am giving this lotus (2).As for the meaning (artha) constructed (kalpita) by ignorant people (bāla), this construct (kalpita) is at least not the meaning. Rather, I give this offering to the supreme person (varapudgala) to take away all constructions (sarvakalpacchedanāya) (3).Thus this flower offering will give me no maturing fruit (vipākaphala). Rather, I give this offering to take away all substances (sarvavastucchedanāya) (4).In my Buddha-land (buddhakṣetra) only the victorious supreme way (jinavarayāna) will be followed, the words śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha are even not mentioned (5).
(On the emptiness of any spiritual attainment:) Then the venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana spoke the following verse to the boy Ratnadatta:
Even if you have given an offering to this teacher with faith (śraddhā), how will you ever become a Buddha with such a perverted attitude (viparītamati) (1)?Then the boy Ratnadatta spoke the following verses to the venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana:All these things are unborn (anutpanna), the composite things (saṃskṛta) are empty (tuccha) and worthless (rikta). So, among such things (dharma), where is something which really originates (vastuta utpadyate) (1)?You are clad in the orange monk’s robes (kaṣāyacīvara), and hold on to the role of a holy man (arhattvaṃ gṛhṇāsi), but is not the consciousness of this [role] (tadvijñāna), as well as its object (gocara) [viz. the role itself], only empty (śūnya) (2)?The ten millons Buddhas are not pleased (āragita) by one based on conceptions (upalambha), but if one peacefully (śānta) regards them, there is not one of the ten millons who are not pleased (ārāgita) (3).So how can Maudgalyāyana be the victim of such conceptions? You should rather purify your thoughts (citta) [of preconceptions], whoever the person is making an offering (4)!
(Dialogue between Ratnadatta and Mahāmaudgalyāyana on the ontological status of bodhi and tathāgata:) Then the venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana addressed himself to the boy Ratnadatta:But, my boy, has not the Tathāgata realized the incomparable perfectly complete awakening, does he not teach religion (kathaṃ dāraka tathāgato nānuttarāyāṃ samyaksambodhāv abhisaṃbuddho na dharmaṃ deśayati sma)?Ratnadatta answered: the wise should not make awakening the object of discursive thoughts (na paṇḍitena bodhiḥ prapañcayitavyā) or construct the Tathāgata by his conceited thoughts (na ca tathāgato manyitavyaḥ),he should not make construction as “moments of existence do not arise” (na dharmaṃ notpadyanta iti kalpayitavyam),he should not make construction as “all moments of existence are composite” (na sarvadharmāḥ saṃskṛtā iti kalpayitavyam),he should not make construction as “all moments of existence are non-composite” (na sarvadharmā asaṃskṛtā iti kalpayitavyam),he should not make construction as “being born and unbornness (utpādānutpāda)”, “existent and non-existent (bhāvābhāva)”, “grasping and giving up (heyopadeya)”, “connection and disconnection (saṃyogaviyoga)”, “going and coming (gatyāgati)”, “remaining and changing existence (sthiticyuti)”, “states of desire, dislike or bewilderment (rāgadharmadveṣadharmamohadharma)”,he should not make constructions like “truth or untruth” (na dharmādharma iti kalpayitavyam).̌“Because of ignorance (avidyā) there is birth (upapatti) in the states of ordinary men, disciples, isolated buddhas (pṛthagjanadharmaśrāvakadharmapratyekabuddhadharmabuddhadharma), in impure and pure states (saṃkliṣṭadharmavyavadātadharma), in states of forms (rūpin), without form (ārūpya), with or without conceptual thinking (saṃjñyasaṃjñin), with or without essential character (lakṣaṇālakṣaṇa), of pure conduct (pariśuddhacaryā), where things are seen as universally equal or non-equal (samatāsamatā), in body (kāya), mind (citta), where all things are fundamentally understood or not fundamentally understood (sarvadharmayoniśo’yoniśaḥ)”, such constructions he should not make (iti na kalpayitavyam).So what do you mean, Maudgalyāyana, has the Tathāgata realized the incomparable perfectly complete awakening (tat kiṃ manyase maudgalyāyana tathāgato nānuttarāyāṃ samyaksambodhāv abhisaṃbuddhaḥ)?Maudgalyāyana answered: Well then, [according to what you have said] he cannot have (uvāca no hīdam).Ratnadatta said: But can it be accepted that the Tathāgata is not included in things as they are, that awakening is not included in things as they are, that an ordinary being is not included in things as they are (uvāca kiṃ tu na tathāgatas tathatāntargato na bodhis tathatāntargatā na pṛthagjanas tathatāntargata iṣyante)?Maudgalyāyana answered: No, it can also not be [accepted that he is not included in things as they are] (maudgalyāyana uvāca no hīdam).Ratnadatta said: Maybe you foster discursive thinking about what is beyond discursive thought (ratnadatto dāraka uvāca tvaṃ maudgalyāyana niṣprapañcaṃ prapañcayasi)?Maudgalyāyana answered: As for me, I teach by means of conventions [understood by] the world (maudgalyāyana uvaca ahaṃ tu lokasaṃvṛtyā deśayāmi).The boy said: Maudgalyāyana, the world has the form of nothing but untruth, deception and illusion (mṛṣāmoṣamāyākāra), and it deceives only the foolish (bāla).Maudgalyāyana said: If the world consists only of states of untruth and deception, then also this teaching of yours must be untruth and deception. So why do you then teach it (maudgalyāyana uvāca sacel loko mṛṣāmoṣadharmā ayaṃ ca nirdeśo ’pi mṛṣāmoṣadharmaṃ tvaṃ kasmād deśayasi)?Ratnadatta said: Since all moments of existence cannot be definitely be pointed out, they cannot be demonstrated, or have a conclusion reached about them (uvāca sarve dharmā maudgalyāyanānidarśanā na te pratipādyāḥ prāpyāś ca).Thus they can also not be realized, abandoned, fully known or cultivated in meditation (na sākṣātkartavyā na prahātavyā na parijñeyā na bhāvayitavāḥ).Maudgalyāyana said: But for what reason do you make an offering to the Tathāgata (maudagalyāyana uvāca atha tvaṃ yadarthaṃ tathāgataṃ pūjayasi)?The boy said: Maudgalyāyana, are you the Tathāgata? Are you the giver of the offering? Or are you one fostering all kinds of conceptions on giving (dāraka uvāca tvaṃ maudgalyāyana tathāgato vā dātā vā dānam vopalabhase)?To this the venerable Maudgalyāyana had nothing to say (athāyuṣmān maudgalyāyanas tūṣṇīṃbabhūva).The boy Ratnadatta said: Thinking in this way, Maudgalyāyana, I have completely given up becoming a Tathāgata – those fostering the attitude found in the way of diciples have in fact not attained much (ratnadatto dāraka uvāca mayā maudgalyāyana tataś cintayitvā tathāgato bhavituṃ parivarjitam. ye śrāvakayāne cittāny utpādayanti lābhā te durlabdhā iti).
(Being asked by Maudgalyāyana, verses by Ratnadatta on true and conventional learning, and the empty identity of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa:) Maudgalyāyana said:
As for your age, you are very young, but you are like an ocean by your insight (prajñā)! How long have you been trained (śikṣita) in these teachings (dharma) (1)?Ratnadatta said:All my learning (śikṣā) has disappeared, because what is learning is really not learning: That in which there is no learning is the learning of the wise (1).The topics (artha) on which you have asked me are all within the common concepts of any being (sattvasaṃjñā). In this [teaching, however,] no origination (utpāda) is found among any moments of existence anywhere (2).The foolish (bāla) construct (kalpayanti) awakening (bodhi) and existence (saṃsāra), but how can you, the reverend monk (bhadanta), admit the teachings of the foolish (bāladharma) (3)?The wise do not construct (na kalpayanti kuśalāḥ) questions like “How long?” “How short?”, since moments of existence have no age: this is the way one should understand them (4).̌“Foolish (bāla)”, “teachings of the foolish (bāladharma)”, “teachings of the Buddha (buddhadharma)” or “The Victorious (jina)”, the wise (dhīmat) do not make such distinctions. You should rather see such things as part of emptiness (śūnyatā) (5).̌“The great sage (maharṣi) attained Awakening (bodhi)”, this is an illogical construction (ayuktakalpanā): since there is no origination (utpāda) among the moments of existence, how can there be an extinction (nirvāṇa) to be obtained (6).The moments of existence are endless (ananta), the Lord has said, and a liberated (vimukta) being is inexistent (abhāva). So do understand that there is no difference between existence and extinction (7)!Among all these forms there is no increase or decrease, the wise are not deluded (na muhyante) by the moments of existence without distinctions (aprabhinna) (8).The foolish believe they have attained and found, the foolish believe they have attained extinction (nirvāṇa): they are rather passionately attached to existence (saṃsārasārakta), conceited thinking (manyanā) is the snare of the Evil One (mārabandhana) [which binds them] (9).One thinking “I have attained” has not attained anything, he has rather succumbed to the ignorance (avidyā) by which he goes to new rebirths (punarbhava) (10).After one is placed on the seat of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa) there are no viewpoints (dṛṣṭi) and nothing more to get rid of. And this awakening (bodhi) of the Buddhas is only a conventional expression (vyavahāra) without meaning (anartha) (11).It is impossible to express the awakening (bodhi) and extinction (saṃsāra) with conventional expressions (vyavahāra): Those viewing things this way discern (vijānanti) the true state of things (dharmatā) (12).
(The Lord relates Ratnadatta’s earlier lives:) Then the venerable Śāriputra asked the Lord:How long, Lord, has the boy Ratnadatta practised this teaching?The Lord said: At the time the Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara gave me the prophecy of awakening (vyākaraṇa), when I had reached the kind of tolerance that all moments of existence are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣāntipratilabdha), at that time this boy was the greatest of the bodhisattvas established in emptiness (śūnyatāpratiṣṭhita), according to the words of Dīpaṃkara. And at the time I was one for the first time to produce the thought of incomparable perfect awakening (anuttarāyai samyaksaṃbodhaye prathamacittotpādika), at that time three hundred thousand kalpas had elapsed since this boy attained that tolerance (kṣāntipratilambha).Śāriputra said: But Lord, what is the cause (hetu), what is the reason (pratyaya) why this boy Ratnadatta has not reached the incomparable perfect awakening?The Lord said: Ask the boy himself, he will tell you.
(Why Ratnadatta has not attained awakening:) Then the venerable Śāriputra addressed the boy Ratnadatta (athāyuṣmāñ śāriputro ratnadattaṃ dārakam āmantrayate sma):Why have you then not reached the incomparable complete awakening (tvaṃ kasya hetor anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau nābhisaṃbuddhaḥ)?Ratnadatta answered: I do not have any conceptions of an incomparable perfect awakening, that is why I do not wake up (ratnadatta uvāca anuttarasamyaksaṃbodher anupalambhāt tasmād nāham abhisaṃbuddhye).Śāriputra said: But this Tathāgata, after his perfect awkening, does not behave according to such conceptions, does he (kiṃ tu tathāgato ’yam abhisaṃbuddhaḥ mopalambhe caret)?Ratnadatta said: If the Tathāgata grasps at [the idea of] complete awakening (yadi tathāgato ’bhisaṃbodhiṃ gṛhṇīyāt?), he is one who is possessed of conceptions (upalambha), and so he does not wake up, he does not renounce (nābhisaṃbudhyeta na prajahyād), such is the teaching (iti dharmavacanāt?).Śāriputra said: How far have you reached in progress in the four qualities (caturdharmapratipatti) and in tolerance (kṣānti) by means of maturing your sense of universal sameness (paripakvasamatayā)?The boy Ratnadatta said: I do not see even one quality completed, so how can there be question of four (ratnadatto dāraka uvāca nāham ekaṃ dharmam api pariniṣpannaṃ samanupaśyāmi kaḥ punar vādaś caturaḥ)? But, now, what is accumulating religious progress (atra katamaḥ samudānayaḥ)? [It is understanding that] religious proclamation is [only] a conception (dharmavijñaptir ity ayam upalambhaḥ), awakening is [only] a conception (bodhir ity ayam upalambhaḥ), that the Tathāgata is [only] grasping [for something inexistent] (tathāgata ity ayam parigrahaḥ), that liberation is only a rhetorical figure (mokṣa ity ayaṃ prapañcaḥ).
(On the lack of meaning in becoming a monk:) Śāriputra said:It is wonderful (āścarya), son of good family (kulaputra), in practising such teachings (dharma) you are born in the nearness of the Buddhas through miraculous birth (aupapāduka), and will always assume the life of a monk (sadā pravrajasi).
Then the boy Ratnadatta spoke these verses:
Birth (utpāda) and non-birth (utpāda), the two [concepts] are only discursive thinking (prapañca), the region of thought-constructions (saṃkalpabhūmi), the territory of the Evil One (māragocara): grasping for the moments of existence related to the body, etc. (kāyādidharmaparigraha) is only conceited thoughts (manyanā), in which gods of passion (kāmadeva) and pride (asura) are lost (1).Some think: The Victorious (jina) has attained the unconditioned (asaṃskṛta) ambrosia (amṛta), but those who think like that, believe they have themselves clothed the Buddha; what they have attained is not what the leaders [of religion] (nāyaka) have attained (2).Here many people, having become monks (pravrajya), are conceited by the fact that they are monks (pravrajyāṃ manyante), they are really bewildered (vibhramya) by mental conceptions (cittopalambha) and are corrupting the religious teachings (nirdeśadūṣaka) (3).They say: I have attained the ambrosia, but they speak as someone attaining only conceitedness (māna). But in the teachings (nirdeśa) of our protector (trāyin), the lion of the Śākya clan, there is no discursive thinking (prapañca) (4).They do not understand the real nature of thought (cittasvabhāva) in all the aspects of thought, and thus [they do not understand that] the viewpoint (dṛṣṭi) of our teacher (vināyaka) is without any real nature (niḥsvabhāva) (5).Because the viewpoint (dṛṣṭi) proclaimed by the Victorious One (jina) with the pure eye [of wisdom] (viśuddhacakṣur), there is really no view (dṛṣṭir nāsti). And that is why the wise (prajñāvat) do not hold on to a view like “I am liberated” (nāhaṃ mukta iti grāhaḥ) (6).Those who do meditation in grasping for distinguishing marks (nimittagrāhabhāvita) become bewildered (muhyante) by conceptions of themselves (ātmopalambha), thus some unwise people (akuśala) reject emptiness (śūnyatā) calling it inexistence (abhāva) (7).Existent things (bhāva) are like a dream, an illusion (svapnamāyāsadṛśa). But having constructed (kalpayitvā) existence in their thoughts (matinā), these unwise people (akuśala) call it extinction (nirvāṇa), when things existent (bhāva) have disappeared (naṣṭa) (8).Rather, when they base themselves on the body, their [true] concept of morality (śīlasaṃjñā) is destroyed (vinaṣṭa), and by mental conceptions (cittopalambha), their [true] concept of meditation (dhyānasaṃjñā) is destroyed (vinaṣṭa) (9);and in the same way, by conceptions of what insight is (prajñopalambha), the concept of their true potentiality (bījasaṃjñā) is confused (vimūḍha). Because they really are only clever in the ways of the world (lokalaukikakuśala) such people should rather be called thiefs of religion (dharmacaura) (10).In all these moments of existence (dharma) is found the undefiled light (asākliṣṭaprabhāsvara) of true reality (dharmadhātu), so what can you tell me of the meaning of assuming a monk’s life (pravrajyārtha) (11)?All moments of existence are without difference (nānātva), they are like an echo (pratiśrutkā). The wise people never make thought-constructions (na kalpayanti) concerning the field of the saints (āryagocara) (12).In the moments of existence (dharma), which have the essential character of not being anything else but what they are (ananyalakṣaṇa), being what they are (tathatā), not being in another way than they are (ananyathā), being without change (nirvikāra), what is the use of constructing the assuming of a monk’s life (pravrajyākalpanā) (13)?
(On the designation bodhi and the instruction of the bodhisattva in the beginning of his development:) Then the bodhisattva Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta spoke to the boy Ratnadatta:Boy, of what is “awakening” a designation (bodhir iti dāraka kasyaitad adhivacanam)?Ratnadatta said: Mañjuśrī, awakening is no designation (ratnadatta uvāca nāsti mañjuśrīr bodhir adhivacanam).Mañjuśrī said: Thinking what (yataś cintayitvā) do you say so?Ratnadatta said: Mañjuśrī, the nature of things is unthinkable (dharmatā mañjuśrīr acintyā), thinking thus I will teach about it (sā mayaivaṃ cintayitvā nirdeśyā).Mañjuśrī said: But what kind of instruction will you teach, how will you instruct the bodhisattva in the beginning of his development (atra katham ādikarmikasya bodhisattvasyāvavādo nirdeśyaḥ katham anuśāsanīyaḥ)?Ratnadatta said: One should speak like this – do not give up your passion (rāga), do not fight your aversion (dveṣa), do not clear away your bewilderment (moha), do not liberate (uccal-) yourself from your body (kāya), practise (car-) the bad things (akuśala), do not hold back (nigrah-) your views (dṛṣṭi), do not be conscious of the bonds [to the worldly things] (sāyojana), grasp for (parigrah-) the parts of the personality (skandha), amass (piṇḍīkṛ-) the spheres of sense-perception (dhātu), move about (car-) among the fields of sense-perception (āyatana), do not leave (atî-) the stage of fools (bālabhūmi), frequent (āgam-) the bad (akuśala), give up the good (kuśala), do not think of (manaskṛ-) the Buddha, do not reflect (cint-) on religious teachings (dharma), do not give offerings to (pūj-) the congregation of monks (sāgha), do not take the training (śikṣā) upon yourself (samādā-), do not seek (prārthaya-) the peacefulness of existence (bhavaśamana), do not cross over (uttṛ-) the river [of existence] (ogha). This kind of instructions one should teach and give to the bodhisattva in the beginning of his development (ādikarmika).Why? Because this state of the moments of existence and nothing else is their [true] state (iyaṃ dharmāṇāṃ dharmasthitir shitir eva).Foolish people (bāla) explain things (vyākṛ-) in accordance with moments of existence of arising (utpādadharma) and moments of existence of disappearance (nirodhadharma). But this sphere of all moments of existence distinguishes itself by being beyond thought-constructions (sa tu dharmadhātur nirvikalpaprabhāvitaḥ), and understanding the essential character of all these moments of existence in this way is awakening (ya eṣāṃ dharmāṇāṃ svabhāvasyaivamanubodhaḥ sā bodhir iti).If he is taught in this way and does not become afraid, scared or terrified, then he is a bodhisattva not turning back in his development, one who has a part in the stage of never turning back (yady evam upadiṣṭo nottrasen na sātrasyen na sātrāsam āpadyeta sa vatāvaivartiko bodhisattvo ’vaivairtikabhūmibhāgīya iti jñātavyaḥ).By means of this instruction one should carry on a pleasant conversation at length (anenāvavādena punaḥ punaḥ sāmodanīyam).
(Eight provoked monks:) At that time eight monks (bhikṣu), victims of their preconceptions (aupalambhika) did not approve of this kind of religious exposition (dharmaparyāya), and left, going away from that congreagation (parṣad).But warm blood flowed out of their mouths and they died. Then they were born in the great hell (mahānaraka) Raurava.Then Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta addressed the Lord: Lord, did you see the great harm that appeared when these monks had heard this exposition of religion?The Lord said: Do not say that, Mañjuśrī.If these monks had not heard this exposition of religion, they would never have been born in the good places of the universe (sugati) in a million kalpas (kalpanayuta), and so, how could they meet and please a Buddha?Now they will, even though they heard this exposition of religion with doubt (sakāṅkṣā), be born in the Tuṣita heaven after they have died (cyutvā) in the great hell Raurava.Then, in sixty-eight kalpas, they will please (ārāgayiṣyanti) ten times hundred thousand milloins of Tathāgatas, and they will by miraculous birth (aupapāduka) be born as universal kings (cakravartirāja).And during one kalpa, they will be born as Tathāgatas, Arhats, Perfect Buddhas with the name Vimalaprabha.
(Sons of gods praising the teaching:) Then those sons of gods (devaputra) heard those prophecies, and, with eighty thousand others went to the place where the Lord was staying, and sprinkled divine flowers (divyapuṣpa) all over the city of Vaiśālī.All of them were overjoyed by this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya), saying: Lord, we are so happy, and we pray that you will disseminate this way of awakening (bodhinaya) of the Tathāgatas.In the moment of their happiness they became [bodhisattvas] never turning back (avaivartika) from the incomparable perfect awakening,and eighty-four thousand beings in Vaiśālī became [bodhisattvas] never turning back (avaivartika) from the incomparable perfect awakening.Twelve thousand developed a pure sight for the moments of existence, without impurities (virajo vigatamalaṃ dharmeṣu dharmacaṣkṣur viśuddham).
(On the merit of the teaching:) Then the Lord addressed Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta:Mañjuśrī, if you compare a bodhisattva who practises the six perfections (ṣaḍpāramitā) in a period of hundred thousand kalpas without expedient means (upāyakauśalya) with whoever hears this exposition of religion even with doubt (sakāṅkṣa), then the last mentioned has acquired more merit (puṇya) than the former.So what shall we say about whoever hears it without doubt (akāṅkṣa)?And what shall we say about whoever writes it down, whoever reads it, remembers it and teaches extensively to others?Mañjuśrī, whoever wishes to attain the stage of a a saint (arhattva) should be trained in this teaching (dharma), whoever wishes to attain isolated awakening (pratyekabodhi) should be trained in this teaching, and whoever wishes to attain the incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi) should be trained in this teaching.
(Ratnadatta’s imperishable offering:) Then the boy Ratnadatta said to his nurse: Nurse, give me some food so that I can give an offering to the Lord!Then the boy Ratnadatta’s nurse filled a bronze vessel with food of eight tastes and gave it to the boy Ratnadatta, and the boy Ratnadatta said to the Lord:Lord, as long as the whole of this congregation of monks is not satisfied with the truth which is the truth of the imperishability of all moments of existence (sarvadharmākṣayatāsatya), there will be no decrease of what is in this bronze vessel!Then, after filling the almsbowl of the Lord, the boy Ratnadatta said to the congregations of monks: Venerables, he who out of compassion (anukampām upādāya) for me will accept these alms (piṇḍapāta) which will bring me great fruit (bṛhatphala), he who will not purify the gift by his body (yo na dakṣiṇāṃ kāyena viśodhayati), who will not purify the gift with his thought (yo na cittena viśodhayati), when to whom it is given there is no merit (puṇya) or maturing result (vipāka), for whom there is no action (karman) by body, speech or mind, who does not cling to the unconditioned (saṃskṛta), who is not sullied by the qualities of the ordinary person (pṛthagjanadharmānupalipta), not dependent on the qualities of the disciple (śrāvakadharmānāśrita), he who has not started on the way of the Buddha (buddhayānāniryāta), who wishes not to start on the way of the Buddha, may he receive it! After this no one from the congregations of monks received the vessel.Then the boy Ratnadatta said: As for me, I wish to give, and you wish to eat, and I have no expectations whatsoever (niṣpratikāṅkṣa) to the venerables, so accept!The splendour of qualities of the buddha-fields (buddhakṣetraguṇavyūha) of a hundred thousand times ten million bodhisattvas of the greatness of Mañjuśrī, a hundred thousand times ten million times greater than this will be the qualities of my buddha-field!By this truth (satya), by the truth in this word of truth (satyavacana), by this word of truth, may the almsbowls of all of you be filled from this bronze vessel, and may the bronze vessel never be exhausted (parikṣi-)!Then the almsbowls of the monks in all those congregations were filled, and as many were the crowds of inhabitants in that city, all of them were satisfied by the boy Ratnadatta with food having eight tastes. But the alms were not consumed (na kṣīṇa).
(The admonition of the Lord to a bodhisattva:) Then the Lord spoke to the boy Ratnadatta:These, Ratnadatta, are the five kinds of purification of a gift. What five? (atha bhagavān ratnadattaṃ dārakam āmantrayate sma, pañcemāni ratnadatta bodhisattvasya dakṣiṇāpariśodhanāni, pañca katamāni, tad yathā): He does not have conceptions of the body (kāyaṃ nopalabhate), he has no conceptions of the thoughts (cittam nopalabhate), he is not attached to the gift (dāne ’nabhiniviṣṭaḥ), he wishes no result (vipāke niḥspṛhaḥ), he wishes no result for the ones receiving the gift (pratigrāhakānām avipākaḥ).And these four things, Ratnadatta, the bodhisattva should realize. What four? (catvāra ime ratnadatta nityā sākṣātkartavyāḥ, katamāś catvāraḥ, tad yathā): Concentration on emptiness (śūnyatāsamādhiḥ), recollection of the Buddha (buddhānusmṛtiḥ), absolute compassion (mahākaruṇā), maturation of own former actions (svakarmavipāka).
(Prophecy of Ratnadatta given by the Lord: Ratnadatta will be a perfect Buddha in thirty kalpas with the name Amoghabalakīrti. The number of disciples will be immeasurable (ananta), they will all be avaivartika bodhisattvas, their lustre will be immeasurable, as well as their span of life.)
(Mañjuśrī asks for the title of the exposition of religion, which is given as Bodhisattvacaryā, (as in the title above) and “The being from the real nature of the moments of existence” (dharmatājana).)
(The Lord leaves with his monks.)
